# oeis-min

This is a Rust tool that looks for the smallest number that is not in the [The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS)](https://oeis.org), in an attempt to answer the [Interesting number paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interesting_number_paradox).

## Usage

First, download and extract a copy of the OEIS database from [https://oeis.org/stripped.gz](https://oeis.org/stripped.gz)
